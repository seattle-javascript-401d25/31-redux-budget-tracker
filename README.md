This is a budget tracker where a user can log the name of an expense and its amount, and populate a document with budget cards. Users can delete and update, created cards, and we have yet to make our budget info cards persistent.

CREATE - creates a new budget card and renders it to the DOM

Update - updates an existing budget card in the DOM

Delete - deletes an existing budget card
